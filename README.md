This is the team MAAC's hackathon project - GROUP CHAT ANALYSER
The main file is App.py which is connected to helper.py and preprocessor.py.
When you run App.py, a link will be generated (e.g - streamlit run C:\Users\abhis\PycharmProjects\pythonProject4\App.py), which when run in the python's terminal will open the main web application. 
Now, user will have to export a chat in whatsapp and transfer it in the pc (we have provided one text file for analysing annd testing) which will be selected to analyse.
