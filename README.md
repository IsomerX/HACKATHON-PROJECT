This is the team MAAC's hackathon project - GROUP CHAT ANALYSER.
The main file is App.py which is connected to helper.py and preprocessor.py.
When you run App.py, a link will be generated (e.g - streamlit run C:\Users\abhis\PycharmProjects\pythonProject4\App.py), which when run in the python's terminal will open the main web application. 
Now, user will have to export a chat in whatsapp and transfer it in the pc (we have provided one text file for analysing and testing) which will be selected to analyse.
When the application is open, please upload the DEMO_TEXT_FILE to analyse..
